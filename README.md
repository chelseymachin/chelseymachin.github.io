# Personal Portfolio Site
## HTML / CSS / JavaScript

### Description
This site serves as my homebase on the internet!  It's a platform to display my projects, my professional history, and gives potential employers a chance to get to know me and download my resume as well.  There's links to my different social media platforms (LinkedIn and Github), and a link to send an email directly to my designated email address.  It's fully responsive, and developed mobile-first.  There are .gifs representing use of the project as a link to the Github repository for the project directly.

### Technical Details
This site was adapted from a pre-existing HTML layout template.  I overhauled it with CSS and some JS functionality for fanciness reasons.  The HTML is semantic and easy to read, and the CSS is designed to be similarly structured.  It's hosted through the generic Github page publication feature (because it's free!).
